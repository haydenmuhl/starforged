    Deliev is helping escort some settlers that are moving through the Aurora,
    but the blockade has left them stranded. Supplies are getting scarce and
    people are getting desperate.

Del: Kaleb. Kaleb!
Kaleb: I'm not listening to you.
Del: These people need your help.
Kaleb: It's not my problem.
Del: People are going to start dying if we don't find a way around the blockade.
Kaleb: There's too many people anyway.
Del: I know you don't mean that. Besides, what's so important that you have to get out of here so quickly?
Kaleb: Didn't you hear? People are going to start dying. I don't want to be one of them.
Del: You can be a real asshole, you know?
Kaleb: Look, I've got a lead on some salvage further voidward, and I need to get there before someone beats me to it. You're headed in the wrong direction.
Del: All we need is a way around the blockade. A few days to chart a course, and then you'll be on your way.  And... I'll owe you.
Kaleb: Owe me? What do you have that I could need?
Del: Someplace out of the way to set down. A warm meal. No troublesome questions.

Kaleb stops what he's doing. His shoulders slump.

Kaleb: Damn it. I know I'm going to regret this.
Del: So you'll do it?
Kaleb: Yes, fine, I'll do it.
Del: I want you to swear it.

Del holds out her iron medallion of the Spiral. Kaleb nods and then takes up the medallion. They clasp it between their hands as Kaleb swears his vow.

Kaleb: I swear, I will find you a way around that blockade.

    Kaleb's going to have trouble getting off the station.

Del puts her hand on the back of Kaleb's head and gives him a rough peck on the forehead. Kaleb objects, mildly.

Del: You don't know what this means to me.
Kaleb: It'll take me a few hours to do some last minute prep for the journey.
Del: Alright. I'll let the others know.

Del darts off into the crowd.

    What's going to hold up Kaleb?
    (95, 02) Threaten advantage
    Someone else is after the same salvage, and has sabotaged Kaleb's ship in an attempt to slow him down.

A few hours later Kaleb is making his final preparations, and Del walks on board.

Del: How long until we go?
Kaleb: We? What do you mean we?
Del: The Abbess gave me permission to come with you, to help chart the new passage.
Kaleb: Damn it. Fine. I don't have time to argue with you. The faster we get this done, the faster I can get to that salvage.

    Does the sabotage happen within range of the Aurora?
    Ask the Oracle, 50/50
    (80) Yes

The Borealis undocks from the Aurora and navigates with its thrusters to make enter the first drift. As the e-drive spins up, an explosion rocks the port side of the ship, sending it careening off course.

    (4+4 vs 5,5) Strong hit, match

    Momentum: 3

    Strong Hit: The e-drive wasn't disabled.
    Match: The sabotage has a hallmark of someone Kaleb knows.

The ship bucks. Kaleb struggles to get the ship under control and eventually does so.

Kaleb: Fuck!
Del: What was that!?
Kaleb: I don't know! I'll have to check it out to see what happened. Stay here. I'll call you on the radio if I need something.

Kaleb dons his pressure suit and heads out to survey the damage. There's a blast mark and a hole, but upon inspection, it can be patched up enough to get under way. Working with Del in the cockpit, the e-drive eventually hums back to life.

Kaleb heads back inside, and walks into the cockpit.

Kaleb: That FUCKER!

    Who?
    Pronouns: (1-3: he, 4-6: she) (2) he/him
    (LV) Lazlov

Del: Who?
Kaleb: Lazlov. I know it was him.

    Is Kaleb right about this?

    Momentum: 5

    Strong hit: It was definitely Lazlov.
    Match: Part of the device he used survived. Evidence, and maybe something to be used for payback.

Del: ...Who???
Kaleb: Another scavenger. Look at this. It was connected to the e-drive and set to overload. It was probably supposed to destroy itself, but Lazlov always was a cheap bastard.

Kaleb stows the device.

Kaleb: I'll deal with that later. Let's get going.

Kaleb spins up the e-drive again...

    We're trying to circumnavigate the blockade. We probably want to be stealthy.

    Is there a scout from the blockade here?
    Ask the Oracle, 50/50
    (02) No

    What is the nature of the peril here?
    (04, 54) Affect life
    There's bad radiation here.
    We've got to protect ourselves from the radiation, and find a safe way for people to jump here.
