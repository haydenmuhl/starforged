Kaleb and Del have just made their first jump trying to try and chart a course
around the blockade of the Aurora. As soon as they arrive an alarm begins to
sound in the cockpit.

Del: Elevated levels of radiation detected.
Kaleb: Well, that's not good.

Kaleb flips a few switches and shutters begin to come down over the windows.

Kaleb: We'd better get to the center of the ship, unless you want your kids to
       have three arms. We might want to put on our pressure suits while we're
       at it. They'll have some extra shielding.

They don their suits and head towards the engine room. Del starts to poke at a
terminal.

Del: Let's see where this radiation is coming from.

    Space Encouters
    (06) Stellar Object
    (57) Young star incubating in a molecular cloud

Del: This is strange. All that's out there is a proto-star. It shouldn't be
     putting out this much radiation.
Kaleb: Well, let's see if we can't find what's causing this, or someplace
       that's not so exposed.

    +2 momentum, 7

    What kind of planet is forming?
    (86) Rocky world
    (93) Marginal atmosphere

Kaleb: Look at this. There's a planet forming. It might have a magnetic field
       strong enough to block enough radiation that we can wait this out.

Kaleb programs a basic course to orbit the planetoid. As the ship approaches,
the radiation levels begin to fluctuate, then drop.

Kaleb: I think this will work, as long as you've got a pilot who can jump in
       next to this planet.

Kaleb uses the next hour to scan for the next anchorage to jump to.

    They're still trying to stay under the radar, as it were.

    (45) Derelict
    Location: (77) Deep Space
    Type: (65) Derelict starship
    Condition: (45) Cold and dark

Kaleb: Oh, Del, I knew this was a good idea. Look what's off the bow.
Del: That wreck is all yours... _after_ we've finished charting the new passage.
Kaleb: Oh, come on. We've got a few hours until the e-drive is ready to go again.
       I'm going to head over and take a look. You should come along, it will
       be fun.

    Compel, +heart
    (5+1 vs 5,7) weak hit

Del: I want to make sure we finish charting this passage. Let's do a survey from
     here in the ship.
Kaleb: I'm going over there. There's no substitute for getting your hands dirty.
       If you want to stay here, you can run scans to help map the ship.
Del: If it will help you come back in one piece, I suppose.

Kaleb dons his pressure suit and straps on a thruster pack.

    Outer First Look
    (66) Sending a signal or message

As he's getting ready, Del has started some initial scans and calls Kaleb back
to the cockpit.

Del: I didn't notice it at first, but the ship is transmitting a signal. What
     do you make of this?

    Gather Information, +wits
    (1+2 vs 5,8) miss

    What's the nature of the threat revealed by the message? Action, Theme
    (32, 18) Defy danger

    It's a warning saying to stay away. Does the message say what the threat is?
    Ask the Oracle, 50/50
    (78) Yes

    What's the nature of the threat? Descriptor, Focus
    (31, 96) Depleted viewpoint
    (13, 69) Breached resource

The message being broadcast from the derelict is a short loop, with parts of the
message obscured by static. It's not clear how long it has been floating out here.
Parts of the message are saying to stay away, and that there was damage to a
container and a leak. Kaleb does his best to clean up the signal, but that's all
that can really be made out.

Del: If you won't listen to me, maybe you'll listen to them. It's too risky to
     go over there.
Kaleb: What are we going to do for the next three hours? Just sit here and
       twiddle our thumbs? How about this. I won't go inside. I'll just do a
       survey of the hull.

    What kind of ship is it? Fleet
    (43) Salvager hive
    This is another salvager vessel. Probably similar in size to the Borealis.

Kaleb exits the air lock and pushes off towards the derelict.
After a few minutes, he drifts within range and uses his thruster pack to hover several meters from the hull.
Kaleb does a systematic survey of the hull with his laser scanner.
The scanner projects a pale green grid onto the hull, then a brighter line scans across the grid as it collects data.
The scan takes the better part of a couple hours.
What does Kaleb find?

    the information provides new insight, but also complicates your quest

    Descriptor: (03) Active
    Focus: (44) Lair

    There's something alive and hostile inside.

As Kaleb is finishing up the scans, Del is completing some preliminary analysis.

Del: Kaleb, there's some noise in your scan data that I don't understand.
Kaleb: Noise? What do you mean, "noise"?
Del: It looks like the transmission has interference in it, but you signal is coming in loud and clear. Can you re-scan sector... 42?
Kaleb: Sure thing.

After completing the scan, Del comes back on the radio.

Del: I think you should come on board and see this.
Kaleb: Sounds good. Nothing too exciting from where I'm floating.

Kaleb comes on board and looks over Del's shoulder as he doffs his suit.

Del: Take a look at this. Here are the two scans of sector 42 overlayed on each
     other. Here, on the first scan, is the noise I was talking about. On the
     second scan, that area is clean. An here's an area with noise from the second
     scan, but the same area of the hull is clean on the first scan. Could your
     scanner be malfunctioning?
Kaleb: It seemed to be in good working order. I can check it later to rule that
       out.
Del: OK. It doesn't seem to be a transmission problem. Let's assume for now the
     scanner is working properly. The two scans rule out bumps on the hull. So,
     what is it?
Kaleb: It looks like some kind of vibration, but that ship is cold and dead. I
       didn't detect any activity from the engines or other systems. Yeah, look
       at the shape of the noise. The hull is ringing like a bell. What is in
       that ship?
Del: Well, I don't think it's going anywhere. You'll have plenty of time to come
     back once we're done charting this new passage.
Kaleb: OK. I can take a hint. I'll start charting the next drift.
