Kaleb and Del have just made their first jump trying to try and chart a course
around the blockade of the Aurora. As soon as they arrive an alarm begins to
sound in the cockpit.

Del: Elevated levels of radiation detected.
Kaleb: Well, that's not good.

Kaleb flips a few switches and shutters begin to come down over the windows.

Kaleb: We'd better get to the center of the ship, unless you want your kids to
       have three arms. We might want to put on our pressure suits while we're
       at it. They'll have some extra shielding.
Del: I don't know if we'll

They don their suits and head towards the engine room. Del starts to poke at a
terminal.

Del: Let's see where this radiation is coming from.

    Space Encouters
    (06) Stellar Object
    (57) Young star incubating in a molecular cloud

Del: This is strange. All that's out there is a proto-star. It shouldn't be
     putting out this much radiation.
Kaleb: Well, let's see if we can't find what's causing this, or someplace
       that's not so exposed.

    What kind of planet is forming?
    (86) Rocky world
    (93) Marginal atmosphere

Kaleb: Look at this. There's a planet forming. It might have a magnetic field
       strong enough to block enough radiation that we can wait this out.

Kaleb programs a basic course to orbit the planetoid. As the ship approaches,
the radiation levels begin to fluctuate, then drop.

Kaleb: I think this will work, as long as you've got a pilot who can jump in
       next to this planet.

Kaleb uses the next hour to scan for the next anchorage to jump to.

    They're still trying to stay under the radar, as it were.

    Location: (77) Deep Space
    Type: (65) Derelict starship
    Condition: (45) Cold and dark

Kaleb: Oh, Del, I knew this was a good idea. Look what's off the bow.
Del: That wreck is all yours... _after_ we've finished charting the new passage.
Kaleb: Oh, come on. We've got a few hours until the e-drive is ready to go again.
       I'm going to head over and take a look. You should come along, it will
       be fun.

    Compel, +heart
    (5+1 vs 5,7) weak hit

Del: I want to make sure we finish charting this passage. Let's do a survey from
     here in the ship.
Kaleb: I'm going over there. There's no substitute for getting your hands dirty.
       If you want to stay here, you can run scans to help map the ship.
Del: If it will help you come back in one piece, I suppose.

Kaleb dons his pressure suit and straps on a thruster pack.

    Outer First Look
    (66) Sending a signal or message

As he's getting ready, Del has started some initial scans and calls Kaleb back
to the cockpit.

Del: I didn't notice it at first, but the ship is transmitting a signal. What
     do you make of this?

    Gather Information, +wits
    (1+2 vs 5,8) miss

    What's the nature of the threat revealed by the message? Action, Theme
    (32, 18) Defy danger

    It's a warning saying to stay away. Does the message say what the threat is?
    Ask the Oracle, 50/50
    (78) Yes

    What's the nature of the threat? Descriptor, Focus
    (31, 96) Depleted viewpoint
    (13, 69) Breached resource

The message being broadcast from the derelict is a short loop, with parts of the
message obscured by static. It's not clear how long it has been floating out here.
Parts of the message are saying to stay away, and that there was damage to a
container and a leak. Kaleb does his best to clean up the signal, but that's all
that can really be made out.

Del: If you won't listen to me, maybe you'll listen to them. It's too risky to
     go over there.
Kaleb: What are we going to do for the next three hours? Just sit here and
       twiddle our thumbs? How about this. I won't go inside. I'll just do a
       survey of the hull.

    What kind of ship is it? Fleet
    (43) Salvager hive
    This is another salvager vessel. Probably similar in size to the Borealis.
