The Aurora was one of the larger ships left over from the Jump. When its engines died and could not be repaired, it was repurposed as a space station and became one of the major travel hubs in the Outlands for people looking for a new place to settle. The black hole it orbits makes it an easy anchorage to find. It's a place of last resort for refugees, and a place to find cheap labor for those with the means.

Star: (70) White Dwarf

An orbital terraforming station. The star is not ideal, but this planet has a rocky surface and enough water ice to support oceans. With luck and hard work the planet below may eventually become a new haven for humanity here in the Outlands. The Aurora provides a steady stream of workers, for those willing to risk the dangerous work on the surface. The planet is on the outer edge of the habitable zone of this system.
